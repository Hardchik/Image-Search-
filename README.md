# Image Search
Myntra Image Search ML Model:
<ul>
  <li>
In this model, searching via giving color the topmost priority has been implemented. Keras, Tensorflow are used to generate image data and ResNet50, a 50 layer deep Neural Network which is pretrained on ImageNet database to create a model.</li>
  <li>
On the processed data, product attributes have been generated and now KNN (K-nearest neighbours) is implemeted on product attributes to get the nearest result of image search on Myntra clothing website.</li>
</ul>
